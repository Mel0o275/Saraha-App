Asymmetric encryption uses two keys:
    Public key
    Private key

When someone wants to send a secure message:
    He asks for the public key of the other person.
    The message is encrypted using the public key.
    The message is decrypted using the private key, which is only with the owner.

So:
    Public key → encrypt
    Private key → decrypt

Only the person who has the private key can read the message
