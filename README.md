# Saraha-App — First Phase
## Authentication & OTP Implementation

This phase covers:
- User registration & login
- Email OTP (one-time password) for verification / password reset flows (depending on your design)
- JWT-based authentication (token in headers)
- Secure password handling (hashing)

---

## Tech Stack (suggested)
- **Node.js + Express**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **JWT** for auth
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **Nodemailer** (or your OTP email helper library) for sending OTPs
