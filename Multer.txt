Multer is a middleware in Node.js + Express.
Its main job is handling file uploads.

When a user uploads:
                an image
                a PDF
                or any file

Multer is the one that:
                    receives the file from the request
                    processes it
                    saves it on the server (disk or memory)
                    and then attaches it to the request object
                    instead of dealing with raw file data yourself
